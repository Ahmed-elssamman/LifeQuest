# Database

`prisma/schema.prisma` defines the normalized relational model. Migration SQL adds checks and immutability triggers not expressible in Prisma. Apply migrations with `db:deploy`; develop new migrations with `db:migrate`. Never reset shared Neon or manually edit deployed schemas. Runtime uses the pooled `DATABASE_URL`; CLI migrations use `DIRECT_URL`.

The initial migration creates all domain relations. The integrity migration enforces positive amounts, bounded progress/mood/energy, ordered challenge dates, no self-friendship and one milestone parent. It makes XP/audit append-only and freezes challenge rules/baselines/results. The snapshot migration backfills eligible habits/timezones and freezes eligibility, scoring configuration and metrics. Existing final seeded results are preserved; a backfill cannot reconstruct unrecorded historical habit edits.

Important uniqueness rules include one habit log per habit/calendar day, one check-in per user/day, one participant per challenge/user, one final score per participant/challenge, one friendship per sorted pair, one achievement unlock per user/achievement, and globally unique XP/redemption idempotency keys.

Indexes follow list patterns: user/status, habit/date, due dates, project/goal foreign keys, challenge state/timing, notification read state, feedback status/category and audit timestamps. Avoid adding indexes without an actual query pattern. JSON is reserved for flexible analytic/audit/XP metadata.

Account deletion cancels unfinished shared challenges, rechecks the active account/password under its lock, and erases personal free text, reflections, experiments, feedback attachments/replies, analytics and social connections, invalidates identity and sessions, and anonymizes retained domain records. Minimal pseudonymous append-only XP, audit and challenge evidence remains for integrity. A production retention/purge policy must be chosen explicitly for the deployment jurisdiction.

Local integration tests deploy migrations into a `_test` database. E2E uses a separate test database. `db:check-migrations` replays SQL into an isolated local shadow database and compares it with the Prisma schema.

Migration four adds `QuestTemplate` and ordered `QuestTemplateItem` records for optional staff-published missions. Users copy templates into their own independent quests; editing a template never rewrites existing user work. Avatar presets and private screenshot metadata use the original profile/feedback models.

`core/habit-streaks.ts` calculates complete daily/custom/weekly runs with indexed log evidence and SQL window functions. Client list payloads keep only recent logs; a long streak is not limited by the display window.

Migration five enforces ordered start/end dates for goals, projects and tasks. The API validates merged PATCH values before writing; equal dates and optional open-ended plans remain valid. Project moves cannot silently leave tasks explicitly linked to a different goal.

Migration six supplies shared, atomic rate-limit buckets for serverless instances. Migration seven (`20260928180000_audit_query_indexes`) adds nine indexes for milestone/task parents, feedback conversation children, challenge evidence by user/time, and expired session/token cleanup. Migration eight adds `AttachmentDeletion`, an indexed outbox of opaque file keys scheduled transactionally during account erasure. Migration nine (`202610020001_reward_preferences`) adds reward cooldown/time contexts, optional redemption ratings, favorites and savings targets without changing existing XP or redemption rows. All nine migrations replay cleanly against the schema in the isolated local database. On 28 September Neon contained six finished migrations; the three newer additive migrations remain pending for a controlled release. No production data was reset or migrated during this work.

Both configured Neon URLs were checked read-only, and their external TLS handshake verified TLS 1.3. Neon terminates TLS at its edge, so backend `pg_stat_ssl` alone does not describe client-to-Neon transport. Connection strings and certificates are not included in audit documentation.

Prisma stores these `DateTime` fields as UTC `timestamp` values. Raw SQL explicitly casts ISO UTC timestamp text and literal calendar dates, so rate-limit windows, streaks and monthly XP do not change when a database session uses a different timezone. Regression tests exercise both `Pacific/Honolulu` and `Africa/Cairo`.

Attachment metadata disappears as part of erasure while its storage keys remain in the private cleanup outbox. Successful idempotent removal deletes the queue row; failures retain it with a delayed retry time. Standalone maintenance runs every minute and Vercel uses the existing authenticated scheduled-maintenance endpoint. The queue has a bounded batch and an index on retry/creation time. Set a cleanup/retention service level appropriate to the deployment cron schedule.
